#To determine the class of a variable. Examples used from the HarvardX course & tal. 
class(total)


#To determine the structure of a data frame
str(murders)

#Show first six lines of a dataframe
head(murders)

#Length shows you how many rows of data there are
length(murders$population) 
#The above code will show you that there are 51 rows in the dataframe. 

#Factors are stored as categorical data
levels(murders$region) 
shows all the unique values of region. 

#Sorts in ascending order
sort(data$WhiteElo)
murders$state[order(murder_rate, descreasing = TRUE)]

#Get the index number which has the max value
> i_max <- which.max(data$WhiteElo)
> i_max
[1] 77
> data$White[i_max]
[1] "KeithGarrett"

#Add a new column to a data frame
murders <- mutate(murders, murder_rate = total/murders$population*1000000)

#Filter based on a condition
filter(murders, rate <0.71)

#Use the select statement
new_table <- select(murders, state, total)
